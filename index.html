        Ornithology is the scientific study of birds, focusing on their
        behavior, ecology, physiology, classification, and conservation. It
        examines aspects such as bird migration, breeding patterns,
        vocalizations, and their roles in ecosystems. This field plays a crucial
        role in biodiversity conservation, as birds are key indicators of
        environmental health.
